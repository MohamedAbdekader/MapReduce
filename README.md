# MapReduce
A map reduce program where the mappers read from files and the reducers receive the input and output to files.

Input:
Your program should take three arguments as input:
1) m: number of mappers
2) r: number of reducers
3) dir: a directory that contains m input files
An example is
./lab6 3 2 /users/mohamed/testlab6
The directory will contain m input files input0, input1, .... You should assign each to a mapper.
